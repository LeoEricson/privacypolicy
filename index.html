        <p>We don't collect or store your data, period.</p>

        <p>We physically can't. We have nowhere to store it. We don't even have a server database to store it. So even if Justin Bieber asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn't have anything to show him.</p>

        <p>So why collect something we can't even store? We don't.</p>
